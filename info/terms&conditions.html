          <h1>Terms and Conditions</h1>
          <p>
            Please read these Terms and Conditions ("Terms", "Terms and
            Conditions") carefully before using the website (the "Service")
            operated by RainyDays ("us", "we", or "our").
          </p>
          <p>
            Your access to and use of the Service is conditioned on your
            acceptance of and compliance with these Terms. These Terms apply to
            all visitors, users, and others who access or use the Service.
          </p>
          <p>
            By accessing or using the Service you agree to be bound by these
            Terms. If you disagree with any part of the terms then you may not
            access the Service.
          </p>

          <p>
            <span>1. Purchases</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            If you wish to purchase any product or service made available
            through the Service ("Purchase"), you may be asked to supply certain
            information relevant to your Purchase including, without limitation,
            your name, address, payment information, and email address.
          </p>

          <p>
            <span>2. Subscriptions</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            Some parts of the Service are billed on a subscription basis
            ("Subscription(s)"). You will be billed in advance on a recurring
            and periodic basis ("Billing Cycle"). Billing cycles are set either
            on a monthly or annual basis, depending on the type of subscription
            plan you select when purchasing a Subscription.
          </p>
          <p>
            At the end of each Billing Cycle, your Subscription will
            automatically renew under the exact same conditions unless you
            cancel it or RainyDays cancels it. You may cancel your Subscription
            renewal either through your online account management page or by
            contacting RainyDays customer support team.
          </p>
          <p>
            A valid payment method, including credit card or PayPal, is required
            to process the payment for your Subscription. You shall provide
            RainyDays with accurate and complete billing information including
            full name, address, state, zip code, telephone number, and a valid
            payment method information. By submitting such payment information,
            you automatically authorize RainyDays to charge all Subscription
            fees incurred through your account to any such payment instruments.
          </p>
          <p>
            Should automatic billing fail to occur for any reason, RainyDays
            will issue an electronic invoice indicating that you must proceed
            manually, within a certain deadline date, with the full payment
            corresponding to the billing period as indicated on the invoice.
          </p>
          <p>
            <span>3. Fee Changes</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            RainyDays, in its sole discretion and at any time, may modify the
            Subscription fees for the Subscriptions. Any Subscription fee change
            will become effective at the end of the then-current Billing Cycle.
          </p>
          <p>
            RainyDays will provide you with reasonable prior notice of any
            change in Subscription fees to give you an opportunity to terminate
            your Subscription before such change becomes effective.
          </p>
          <p>
            Your continued use of the Service after the Subscription fee change
            comes into effect constitutes your agreement to pay the modified
            Subscription fee amount.
          </p>
          <p>
            <span>4. Refunds</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            Certain refund requests for Subscriptions may be considered by
            RainyDays on a case-by-case basis and granted at the sole discretion
            of RainyDays.
          </p>
