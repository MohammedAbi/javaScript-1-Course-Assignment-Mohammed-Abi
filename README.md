# JavaScript 1 - Course Assignment

## Brief

This project involves using JavaScript to create an interactive online store that displays products from an API endpoint. You can choose from one of the provided API URLs to fetch and display products in HTML, allowing users to add items to their basket and proceed through the checkout process. Styling is optional but recommended, as it enhances the user experience.

### User Stories

- **Add to Basket:** Users can add products to their basket.
- **Remove from Basket:** Users can remove products from their basket.
- **View Cart Summary:** Users can view a summary of their cart on the checkout page.
- **Order Confirmation:** Users receive a thank you message on the confirmation page after checking out.

### Required Pages

- **Home Page:** `/index.html`
